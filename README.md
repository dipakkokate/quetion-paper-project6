# 🧠 AI-Based DevOps & AWS Question Paper Generator

An intelligent system that automatically generates **DevOps and AWS certification-style question papers** using **NLP and Machine Learning** techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ☁️ DevOps & AWS syllabus-based question generation
* 📊 Previous Year Question (PYQ) pattern analysis
* 🤖 AI-powered question generation (T5)
* 🧠 Question classification & similarity check (BERT)
* ⚖️ Difficulty balancing (Easy / Medium / Hard)
* 📑 Automatic exam paper formatting (Q1–Q9 structure)
* 📄 PDF export support

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a **layered architecture**:

1. **Frontend (User Input)**

   * Subject selection (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform, etc.)
   * Syllabus input
   * Exam pattern

2. **Backend (Flask Server)**

   * Handles workflow and API requests

3. **NLP Layer**

   * Tokenization
   * Stopword removal
   * TF-IDF for important topics

4. **Pattern Analysis**

   * Topic frequency from PYQs
   * Domain-wise weightage

5. **AI Engine**

   * T5 → Question generation
   * BERT → Similarity & classification

6. **Smart Selection Engine**

   * Removes duplicates
   * Ensures balanced paper

7. **Paper Structuring**

   * Formats questions into exam pattern

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects a DevOps/AWS subject and inputs syllabus
2. NLP extracts key topics
3. PYQs are analyzed for patterns
4. AI generates questions
5. Smart engine selects best questions
6. Final paper is formatted and exported
